# datasciencecourse3 README
This repository contains the required files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course in the Data Science specialization. Each file is described below:

1. run_analysis.R: The main file that performs all of the data loading, unloading, and data cleaning operations. All 5 of the steps are included and commented in the R Script.
                  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
                  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
                  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. CodeBook.md: This file contains a description of the variables and the tranformations used to generate the final output.
3. summaryData.txt: The data included in the final submission for the project. This includes the averages for each attribute across the subject and activies.
